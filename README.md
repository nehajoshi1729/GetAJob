# GetHired â€“ Job Aggregator

GetHired is a Python-based job aggregator that searches for job postings across multiple job boards using Google search queries. The script extracts job details from the resulting pages and filters them based on customizable criteria such as job type and recency. Additionally, it can compare job descriptions to find similar positions using spaCy's text similarity features.
